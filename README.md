# nosql-challenge

Hands-on project exploring NoSQL database concepts using MongoDB.
Includes data ingestion, cleaning, updates, and analysis with Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

This project was completed as part of the GWU Data Analytics Bootcamp’s NoSQL module. It demonstrates setting up and working with a local MongoDB instance, loading CSV data into a database, and performing CRUD operations. The workflow is split into two Jupyter Notebooks:

Database Setup & Data Cleaning – Load data into MongoDB, validate imports, insert and update records, filter by specific criteria, convert data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Data Analysis – Query the database to identify establishments with specific hygiene scores, rating values, and other parameters, applying sorting and filtering logic to extract insights.

Would you like me to also rewrite this in a more concise, portfolio-ready style so it fits nicely in a GitHub repo with a professional tone? That would make it even more appealing to recruiters.
