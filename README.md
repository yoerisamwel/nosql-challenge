# nosql-challenge

This project was part of the GWU bootcamp. We were introduced to NoSQL databases and their applications in a series of classes and this project was intended to summarize everything we had learned in the classes.

The project consisted of two Jupiter Notebook sections and setting up the local MongoDB on your local computer. 

Jupiter Notebook 1: Eat Safe Love
In this notebook I setup the MongoDB. Rad several check to make sure the CSV containing the data was correctly loaded to the MongoDB under uk_food. After which a new restaurant was inserted into the database and the BusinessTypeID was updated. 
Then I filtered the database on where the local authority name was “Dover”. Updated the Latitude and Longitude datapoints to decimal numbers and confirmed the update went through. I added the 1-5 rating values and changed the data types.

Jupiter Notebook 2: Eat Safe Love
I reconnected to the database that was setup in the previous notebook. Then I ran the analysis based on that database. Sorting on the establishments with a score equal to 20 and getting the count. Then sorting on the Rating value and the hygiene score and getting the counts for those parameters as well.

Overall I thought it was a very interesting part of the bootcamp. I had not worked with NoSQL databases before and found the concept very interesting and am looking forward to working on projects in my career that utilize and apply NoSQL databases in projects.
